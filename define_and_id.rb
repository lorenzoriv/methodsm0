# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
this method checks to see if this string includes the value hello and since it does it will respond with true.


"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
this is checking if the string ends with hello and since it does not it will respond with false.

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
this is checking if this string ends with rld and since it does it will respond with true.

12.even?
this is asking if the number is even so 12.even? would respond with true.

18.next
this is telling the number to go up one digit so 12.next = 13.
