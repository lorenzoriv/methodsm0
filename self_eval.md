# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
After this i am much more confident about using the built in ruby methods.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Writing methods is so much fun but complicated although worth it to make things simpler in the end
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
I want to know how complicated and intresting i can make them and how far i can push the limits of the methods.
